# help-wanted board

This project is intended to provide Techlahoma Usergroup Leaders and committee chairs a place to search for help. The board may be used in this manner:

## I need help

  1. A usergroup leader or committee chair has a task they need completed
  2. The person opens an issue at https://github.com/techlahoma/help-wanted/issues

  - Issue information should include:
    - Usergroup or committee name
    - Contact person
    - Slack/Twitter handle for contact person
    - Brief description of issue
    - Brief description of what is needed

  3. Issue should be tagged with the appropriate usergroup or committee label
  4. That's it!

Techlahoma will advertise the board to volunteers as a way to help Techlahoma and their favorite usergroups.

## I want to help

  1. Browse through open issues at [http://techlahoma.github.io/help-wanted](http://techlahoma.github.io/help-wanted)
  2. Contact the contact person listed on the issue you want to help with
